The statement **`event.target.closest('.answer-container')`** and why it's important.

### **Understanding `event.target`**
- **`event.target`**: When an event, like a click, happens, the `event.target` property represents the specific element that triggered the event. In your case, it could be the `img`, `.answer-text`, or any other child element inside the `.answer-container`.

### **The Problem with `event.target` Alone**
- If you only use `event.target` and directly apply changes, you might be targeting just the specific element that was clicked (like the `img` or `.answer-text`), not the entire `.answer-container`. This can lead to only part of the answer (like just the image) being disabled or styled as incorrect, while the rest remains unaffected.

### **Using `closest`**
- **`closest(selector)`**: This method is called on an element (`event.target` in this case). It looks up the DOM tree (from the target element towards the root of the document) to find the nearest ancestor element that matches the selector you provide, which in this case is `.answer-container`.
- It stops at the first matching element it finds, ensuring you're working with the correct container element.

### **Why Use `closest`?**
- **Scope**: It helps to scope your operation to the nearest `.answer-container`. Even if the user clicks on a child element like an image or text, the `closest` method ensures you get the parent `.answer-container`.
- **Consistency**: This way, you can apply changes (like disabling or styling) to the entire container, ensuring a consistent visual and functional behavior across all child elements.

### **Example Scenario**
Imagine the user clicks on the image inside the answer container. Without `closest`, your code might disable only the image. But with `closest`, you can find the `.answer-container` element and disable it along with all its children (the image and the text), ensuring the entire answer section is treated as incorrect.

### **Visualizing the Structure**
```html
<div class="answer-container">
  <div class="answer-alphabet">
    <img src="assets/a.png" alt="A">
  </div>
  <div class="answer-text">Some Answer</div>
</div>
```
- If the user clicks the `<img>` element:
  - `event.target` is the `<img>` element.
  - `event.target.closest('.answer-container')` finds the `<div class="answer-container">` element, which is what you want to target to apply the "disabled" class to the entire container, not just the image.
